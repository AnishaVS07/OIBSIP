# Internship Projects
I recently completed my five distinct tasks, as part of my data science and machine learning internship at Oasis infobyte.

1. _**IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**_


   This project focuses on the classification of iris flowers into one of three species—setosa, versicolor, or virginica—using the famous Iris dataset. The dataset contains 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Objectives:

-Implement a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on their features.

-Evaluate the model’s performance using various metrics like accuracy.

Approach:

-Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.

-Preprocessed the data, including normalization and splitting it into training and testing sets.

-Selected the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness in handling small datasets.

-Trained the model and evaluated its performance, achieving 1.0 accuracy on the test set.

-Saved the trained model using Python’s pickle library for future use.

Tools & Technologies:

-Python

-Scikit-learn

-Pandas, NumPy

-Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

-Google Colab

Outcome: The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning to a classic classification problem, providing valuable insights into model selection, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation.
